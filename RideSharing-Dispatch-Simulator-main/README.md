🚖 Ride-Sharing Simulator (Python)

📌 Concept

This project simulates a ride-sharing system where:

Riders are managed in a queue (FIFO).
Drivers are assigned using a priority queue (heapq):
Nearest driver gets priority.
If two drivers are at the same distance, the higher-rated driver is chosen.
Each completed ride is recorded in a ride history.

✨ Features

📥 Rider queue using deque
🚗 Driver priority queue using heapq
🎯 Matching algorithm → Nearest + Best driver first
📝 Ride history tracking
